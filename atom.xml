<p>I worked on routing and monitoring protocols for Delay tolerant networks (DTNs) based on a mobile and opportunistic infrastructure using temporal random walks (TRW).</p>

<p>Delay tolerant networks (DTNs) were introduced to deal with environments where interruptions or disruptions of service were expected. Such networks usually lack of end-to-end paths or any infrastructure to help communications. In these networks, mobile nodes may interact using their contacts as a communication opportunity. The store-carry-forward paradigm allows nodes to exploit spatio-temporal paths created by contact opportunities in order to deliver messages over time. Instead we raise the question: can we design a mobile and opportunistic infrastructure that could help deliver messages? In the quest to provide such infrastructure, we study the application of temporal random walks (TRW) over the opportunistic networks. We explore the application and impact of TRW as a minimal and non invasive infrastructure from two points of view: data forwarding and data recollection/transmission.</p>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>I’m originally from <a href="https://chile.travel/">Santiago, Chile</a> where I did my master in Computer Science at <a href="http://www.dcc.uchile.cl">DCC, Universidad de Chile</a>. I used to work at <a href="http://www.nic.cl">NIC Chile</a> research labs. I moved to <a href="https://www.toulouse-tourisme.com">Toulouse, France</a> to do a PhD in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.isae-supaero.fr/fr/">ISAE-SUPAERO</a>, focusing on complex systems. After that I decided to stay looking for new adventures. As a PhD in computer science I have a deep technical understanding that I leverage to deliver high value products, that are useful to people, specially at the intersection of business and technology.</p>

<p>Finishing in product management was natural to me: I’ve always been interested on leveraging technology to find out solutions to practical problems</p>

<p>With more than 15 years of experience, I currently lead the cloud based solution to handle a fleet of autonomous vehicles at <a href="https://www.easymile.com/technology/ezfleet">Easymile</a>. I’ve been involved on the product definition since its conception and pushing for a coherent product strategy, defining the roadmap, following the execution and balancing both business and technical insights in order to add value to our solution.</p>

<p>I love working at different levels of product development, from vision and strategy definition to application prototyping, architecting scalable systems, communicating to internal and external stakeholders, launching into production, helping teams of smart people to solve complex problems and help to focus on outcomes and added value rather than simply delivery.</p>

I’m originally from [Santiago, Chile](https://chile.travel/) where I did my master in Computer Science at [DCC, Universidad de Chile](http://www.dcc.uchile.cl). I used to work at [NIC Chile](http://www.nic.cl) research labs. I moved to [Toulouse, France](https://www.toulouse-tourisme.com) to do a PhD in Computer Science at [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/fr/), focusing on complex systems. After that I decided to stay looking for new adventures. As a PhD in computer science I have a deep technical understanding that I leverage to deliver high value products, that are useful to people, specially at the intersection of business and technology.

Finishing in product management was natural to me: I've always been interested on leveraging technology to find out solutions to practical problems

With more than 15 years of experience, I currently lead the cloud based solution to handle a fleet of autonomous vehicles at [Easymile](https://www.easymile.com/technology/ezfleet). I’ve been involved on the product definition since its conception and pushing for a coherent product strategy, defining the roadmap, following the execution and balancing both business and technical insights in order to add value to our solution.

I love working at different levels of product development, from vision and strategy definition to application prototyping, architecting scalable systems, communicating to internal and external stakeholders, launching into production, helping teams of smart people to solve complex problems and help to focus on outcomes and added value rather than simply delivery.
